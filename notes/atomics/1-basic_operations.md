There are 3 basic operations: write (_store_), load (_read_) and exchange (_swap_);
They do the thing of their naming and they do it in atomic way.
Example in `C`: `atomic_store`, `atomic_load` and `atomic_exchange`.

>There are more in [official documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic), of course.
