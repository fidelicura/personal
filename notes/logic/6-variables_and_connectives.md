Any proposition consists of **variables**, probably, with **connective** that say some relations between variables. 
Variables are usually represented as $a$, $b$, $x$ and so on. You may also want to use $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$.
Each variable always has to be either true or false.

Connectives represent relations between variables using logical operations:
- NOT (_negation_): $p = T, \neg p = F$;
- AND (_conjunction_): $p = T, q = F, p \land q = F$;
- OR (_disjunction_): $p = T, q = F, p \lor q = T$;

There is one more (_that is considered basic_) connective: implication, $p = T, q = F, p \implies q = F$.
Most simple way to think about implication is: we cannot obtain falsity from truth, because truth implies only truth.
