Statement is a **sentence** that is either true or false. Usually, it describes some fact (_if it is $T$_) or nonsense (_if it is $F$_).
Proposition is the **assertion** that we don't know is it true or false.

Example of statement is "Socrates is a man". It is also a proposition.
Important detail: "2 + 2 = 4" and "two plus two equal four" are two statements that share same proposition. [1]
Sometimes, proposition is understood as an "intention".
