Equivalence is like biconditional, but differs in usage: we use binconditional only as operation with two **variables** (_so it is connective_).
We use equivalence when we need to say that two **formulas** are equivalent (_so it is NOT a connective_).
Example: $a = T, b = F, c = F, a \land b \equiv a \land c$.
